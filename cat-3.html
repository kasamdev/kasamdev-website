        <p class="card-text">The death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini after she was detained by Iran's so-called morality police has sparked angry protests, with women burning their headscarves in a defiant act of resistance against the Islamic Republic's strict dress code and those enforcing it.</p>

        <p class="card-text">
          The Gasht-e Ershad (Guidance Patrols) are special police units tasked with ensuring the respect of Islamic morals and detaining people who are perceived to be "improperly" dressed.

          Under Iranian law, which is based on the country's interpretation of Sharia, women are obliged to cover their hair with a hijab (headscarf) and wear long, loose-fitting clothing to disguise their figures.

          Ms Amini allegedly had some hair visible under her headscarf when she was arrested by morality police in Tehran on 13 September. She fell into a coma shortly after collapsing at a detention centre and died three days later in hospital. The force denied reports that officers beat her head with a baton and banged it against one of their vehicles.

          In a rare interview, one morality police officer spoke anonymously to the BBC about his experience working in the force.

          "They told us the reason we are working for the morality police units is to protect women," he said. "Because if they do not dress properly, then men could get provoked and harm them."

          He said they worked in teams of six, comprising four men and two women, and focused on areas with high foot traffic and where crowds gather.

          "It's weird, because if we are just going to guide people why do we need to pick somewhere busy that potentially means we could arrest more people?"

          "It's like we are going out for a hunt."

          The officer added that his commander would tell him off or say he was not working properly if he did not identify enough people violating the dress code, and that he found it particularly difficult when people resisted arrest.

          "They expect us to force them inside the van. Do you know how many times I was in tears while doing it?"
        </p>

        <p class="card-text">
          "I want to tell them I am not one of them. Most of us are ordinary soldiers going through our mandatory military service. I feel so bad."

          The Iranian authorities' fight against "bad hijab" - wearing a headscarf or other mandatory clothing incorrectly - began soon after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, a major aim of which was to make women dress modestly.

          While many women were doing so at the time, miniskirts and uncovered hair were not uncommon sights on the streets of Tehran before the pro-Western Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was overthrown. His wife Farah, who often wore Western clothing, was held up as an example of a modern woman.
          
          Within months of the founding of the Islamic Republic, the laws protecting women's rights that had been established under the Shah began to be repealed.

          "It didn't happen overnight, it was a step-by-step process," said Mehrangiz Kar, 78, a human rights lawyer and activist who helped organise the first anti-hijab protest.

          "Right after the revolution there were men and women on the streets offering out free headscarves to women wrapped in gift paper."

          In August Mr Trump declined to answer questions during an interview at the attorney general's office connected to this civil investigation. Ms James said he repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment right to not self-incriminate, confirming only his name.

          Ms James said that Eric Trump did the same more than 500 times in a 2020 deposition.

          Tristan Snell, a lawyer and former prosecutor who worked on a separate case against Trump University, told the BBC that the lawsuit could take a year to go to trial.

          But the potential of such a trial could severely restrict Mr Trump's ability to do business in New York and profit from his marquee real estate holdings in New York City. It could trigger a series of financial consequences that would make it harder for him to raise capital and maintain credit, Snell said.

          "It definitely could be ruinous for him," Snell said.

          The lawsuit is one of a number of legal issues the former president is facing.

          On 8 August, the FBI conducted a search warrant at his home in Mar-a-Lago as part of an investigation into his handling of classified records. He is also being investigated in Georgia in relation to efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.

          He has also denied any wrongdoing in those investigations.
